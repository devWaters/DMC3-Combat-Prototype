# DMC3 Combat Prototype

This Unity package is a Devil May Cry 3-inspired action combat prototype featuring:

- Combo system
- Dodge mechanic
- Style ranking system
- Enemy AI
- Cinematic camera system (pans and slow-motion freeze frame on enemy kill)
- Demo scene setup

## Getting Started
1. Download the Unity package from the GitHub release for this project.
2. Import the `DMC3CombatPrototype.unitypackage` into your Unity project.
3. Open the included demo scene or drag prefabs/scripts into your own scene.
4. Press Fire1 (Left Ctrl/Mouse Button) for combos, Jump (Space) for dodge.

## Cinematic Camera
- When an enemy is defeated, the camera will pan to the action and trigger a brief slow-motion freeze frame for impact.

## Customization
- You can expand the combo system, add more weapons, adjust camera effects, or extend enemy AI as needed.

For details on usage and customization, see individual script comments and usage notes in the repository.
